# Code Louisville Project
Thi is a simple website project to help me learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It briefly discusses mountain biking in Louisville, KY.

# CSS
I created several CSS classes to help make the website more user friendly.  CSS files include classes to enhance the main header, the text, picture, and the dropdown buttons and its content.

# JavaScript
I used JavaScript to show the list of items under each dropdown menu.  It's not perfect and is a work in progress.
